Abstract: The video supervision systems are preferred for security monitoring, however, the detection of the dynamic or
moving object is a challenging part. In areas wherever automobile parking space is taken by a specific vehicle, the
incorrectly parked vehicles are recognized. It is noted that the license plates of the vehicles are found in several forms, size and conjointly they're completely different in color. This makes the detection of the number plate of a vehicle, the
foremost fascinating and difficult analysis topic. Number plate detection is useful in finding purloined cars, automobile
parking management system and identification of the vehicle in traffic. In our paper, we presented a system which is
utilized to detect and identify the number plate of a particular vehicle and store the data into text form. Along with
Sobel edge detection technique, the morphological operation is used to detect the number plate characters followed by
segmentation approach, in which bounding box procedure is utilized to segment and extract each character from the
number plate. After the segmentation, template matching approach is made use of to match the numbers and characters
of the number plate. The number plate decoded will be used further for identification, matching and documentation
purpose of vehicle details.
